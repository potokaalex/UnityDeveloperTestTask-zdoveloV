## Main goal
Make a button on the screen, by clicking on which upgrades window appears. The window consists of a header, a close button, and a scrollable list of products.

## Requirements:
1. The window should look the same and occupy approximately the same percentage of the screen size at any reasonable resolution.
2. There is also a shading substrate under the window that obscures the contents of the screen behind it.
3. The window closes either by clicking on the close button, or by clicking on any place outside it.
4. The contents inside will scroll. By clicking on the purchase button, the item is purchased and disappears from the list. For the sake of simplification, we can assume that we have 100 money, some goods cost less, some more. Goods that can be bought less, which cannot be bought more.
5. The buttons are animated and have a move. It is triggered only if you release your finger after pressing inside the button. Inactive buttons are not animated.
6. When shown, the window is animated from 80% of the size to 100%.
7. The test task is done in Unity 2022.3.43f1, the result is a project laid out in git.
8. The task should be done through the Unity UI (uGUI), not the UI Toolkit or IMGUI.
9. In addition to the UI of the window, you need to think about the interaction of UI and other code, modularity and how best to do it. The logic of shopping and making a list should not be in the class that shows the UI.  

## Time
